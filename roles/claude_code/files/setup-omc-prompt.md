# OMC Setup — Conductor Prompt

You are the **conductor**. You drive a *second* Claude Code session running in a tmux pane and make it install and verify oh-my-claudecode (OMC). You and that session share the same filesystem, so your final source of truth is the files on disk — **never** the other agent's prose claims.

## Operating principles (read first)

1. **Verify, don't trust.** The inner agent can claim success while being wrong, or warn about a non-problem. After it finishes, you independently check artifacts on disk (Step 6). Its summary is a hint, not evidence.
2. **Every wait is bounded.** The inner agent can stall, crash, hit a usage limit, or show an unexpected menu. No loop may run forever — each has a timeout and an abort path (Step 0). A single Bash-tool call cannot be timed out past **600000ms (10 min) — this is a hard ceiling the harness enforces**, not a suggestion. Every bounded loop below keeps its *internal* deadline comfortably under that ceiling and chains additional bounded waits if genuinely still progressing, rather than requesting one long call that risks colliding with the hard cap (Step 0, `wait_idle`).
3. **Detect state from UI chrome, not generated words.** Claude Code invents new spinner verbs constantly (`Cogitated`, `Razzmatazzing`, …). Do not match verbs. Match stable chrome instead (Step 0).
4. **Two-call rule for ALL TUI input.** `send-keys 'text' Enter` in one call does not submit. Send text, then a bare `Enter`, as separate calls. (Plain shell commands, outside the Claude TUI, may use the combined form.)
5. **Never send a key into the TUI immediately after another key changed its state.** Escape (clearing), typing, and Enter (submitting) each trigger a render/reconciliation pass in the Ink-based UI. Sending the next key before that pass settles is how input gets silently swallowed — a real failure mode, not a hypothetical: a bare `Escape` clear directly preceding text-entry has dropped the text's first character, and text-entry directly preceding `Enter` has swallowed the `Enter` (typing `/exit` opened the slash-command autocomplete dropdown, which absorbed the first `Enter` as a menu action rather than a submit). Fix: put a short settle delay (`sleep 0.4`) after every discrete TUI keystroke action, and verify the visible result before trusting it (Step 0, "Reliable TUI text entry").

## Step 0 — Primitives

**The pane id must be hardcoded into every block.** Your Bash tool calls do *not* share shell state — an env var set in one call is empty in the next. So you cannot rely on `$PANE` persisting. Step 1 prints the pane id once (a stable token like `%3`); from then on **substitute that literal id** wherever a block shows `PANE=%3` or `-t "$PANE"`. Do not guess `session:win.pane`; use the `%N` id. Also derive a per-pane scratch filename by stripping the leading `%` (e.g. pane `%3` → `/tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt`) and substitute that literally too — shell state doesn't persist between calls, so this file (not a variable) is how a "before" snapshot survives from one Bash call to the next.

**State signals (wording-independent):**
- **Busy** (a turn is running): footer line contains `esc to interrupt`.
- **Idle** (turn ended, input box ready): footer contains `⏵⏵ bypass permissions` but **not** `esc to interrupt`, confirmed across **two consecutive polls** (see `wait_idle` below) — a single missed poll of `esc to interrupt` between two tool-call turns of one long agent turn is common and does not mean the turn ended.
- **Shell returned** (Claude exited): no `❯` box and no `bypass permissions` footer; a shell prompt like `…$ ` is present.
- **Abort conditions** (anywhere in output): `usage limit`, `limit reached`, `Invalid API key`, `authentication`, `rate limit`, `Press any key`, or an unexpected `(y/n)` you cannot safely answer.

**Always capture with scrollback** so output that scrolled off is still seen: `tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -200`.

### Reliable TUI text entry

Clearing and typing raced in practice (first character dropped). Don't just delay-and-hope — delay *and* verify the pane actually shows what you typed before you trust it enough to submit. Replace `%3` with the real pane id and `TEXT` with the literal prompt:

```bash
PANE=%3
TEXT='run omc setup, install globally, configure suggested defaults, skip MCP configuration. The caveman plugin is also installed and active. Configure the HUD statusline so that the caveman mode badge appears last in the status line.'
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4; tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" -l "$TEXT"
sleep 0.4
attempt=0
while ! tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -qF "${TEXT:0:24}"; do
  attempt=$((attempt+1))
  if [ "$attempt" -ge 3 ]; then echo "TYPE_VERIFY_FAILED — capture pane and inspect manually"; break; fi
  tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4; tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4
  tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" -l "$TEXT"
  sleep 0.4
done
echo "typed ok (attempt $attempt)"
```

`-l` sends the text literally (no tmux key-name interpretation). Checking the first 24 characters is enough to catch a dropped leading character without being thrown off by line-wrap inside the input box. If `TYPE_VERIFY_FAILED` prints, stop and inspect — don't submit unverified text.

Then, in a **separate** call (two-call rule), snapshot the pane and submit:

```bash
PANE=%3
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -50 > /tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
```

The snapshot feeds the `NOSTART` aliasing guard in `wait_idle` below.

**For slash commands specifically** (text starting with `/`, e.g. `/exit`): send `Enter` twice, with a settle gap, proactively — the autocomplete dropdown that a slash command opens can consume the first `Enter` as a selection rather than a submit, and waiting for `wait_idle` to time out and tell you that wastes a full detection cycle:

```bash
PANE=%3
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -50 > /tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
sleep 0.5
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
```

### `wait_idle` — submit happened, now block until the turn ends

Two-phase (busy must appear, then clear) and bounded, with two hardening fixes over a naive version:
- **Debounce**: idle is only declared after 2 consecutive clean polls, 1s apart — a single-poll miss of `esc to interrupt` between chained tool calls inside one long agent turn is normal and must not be read as "done."
- **Aliasing guard on `NOSTART`**: if busy chrome is never seen within the start budget, don't assume the `Enter` failed — it's also possible the whole turn ran and finished faster than the poll cadence caught it (this happened with a short `omc doctor` run). Diff the current pane against the presubmit snapshot; if content moved, treat it as `IDLE`, not `NOSTART`.
- **Deadline margin**: keep the internal `idle_deadline` at 540s (9 min) — comfortably under the Bash tool's hard 600000ms ceiling — and request a Bash-tool `timeout` of ~595000ms for the call. Never set the two equal; a prior run set both to exactly 600s/600000ms and the harness's own kill won the race, silently discarding the script's own `TIMEOUT`/result line.

Run as a single Bash call (internal `sleep` is allowed; chained `sleep N && cmd` is not), with the Bash tool's own `timeout` param set to `595000`. Replace `%3` with the real pane id and `/tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt` with its snapshot file:

```bash
PANE=%3
PRESNAP=/tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt
poll=1
start_budget=30          # busy must appear within 30s of submit (fresh restarts load hooks/skills and can take >15s)
idle_budget=540          # then idle within 9 min — stays under the Bash tool's 600000ms hard cap with margin
start_deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + start_budget ))
idle_deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + idle_budget ))
saw_busy=0; idle_streak=0; required_streak=2; result=PENDING
while :; do
  pane=$(tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -200)
  if echo "$pane" | grep -qiE "usage limit|limit reached|invalid api key|authentication|rate limit"; then result=ABORT; break; fi
  if echo "$pane" | grep -q "esc to interrupt"; then
    saw_busy=1; idle_streak=0
  elif [ "$saw_busy" = 1 ]; then
    idle_streak=$((idle_streak+1))
    [ "$idle_streak" -ge "$required_streak" ] && { result=IDLE; break; }
  fi
  now=$(date +%s)
  if [ "$saw_busy" = 0 ] && [ "$now" -ge "$start_deadline" ]; then
    if [ -f "$PRESNAP" ] && ! diff -q <(tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -50) "$PRESNAP" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      result=IDLE   # pane content moved even though "esc to interrupt" was never caught — trust the diff over the miss
    else
      result=NOSTART
    fi
    break
  fi
  [ "$now" -ge "$idle_deadline" ] && { result=TIMEOUT; break; }
  sleep "$poll"
done
echo "$result"
```

- `IDLE` → turn finished cleanly; inspect output and proceed.
- `NOSTART` → the aliasing guard already ruled out "it actually ran," so the `Enter` really didn't land. Send one more bare `Enter`, then re-run `wait_idle` **once** (refresh `PRESNAP` first). If it returns `NOSTART` again, treat as stuck and report — don't keep sending blind `Enter`s, since if a menu is open for an unrelated reason a stray `Enter` can select something unintended.
- `TIMEOUT` → busy started but didn't clear within 9 min. Capture the pane: if `esc to interrupt` is still present, this may be a genuinely long step (cold plugin/npm install) rather than a hang — re-run `wait_idle` again, up to **3 chained calls total** (~27 min combined) before giving up. If pane content is byte-identical to a capture taken a poll or two earlier while chrome still claims busy, that's a frozen render, not slow progress — stop chaining and report immediately.
- `ABORT` → capture the offending line, report to the user, stop.

## Step 1 — Launch

This is the **only** place a pane is created. The `echo "$PANE"` prints the id (e.g. `%3`) — record it and substitute it literally into every later block:

```bash
PANE=$(tmux split-window -h -P -F '#{pane_id}'); echo "$PANE"
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" 'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions' Enter
```

Wait until the welcome banner and an empty `❯` box are visible (substitute the real id for `%3`):

```bash
PANE=%3
deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + 60 ))
until tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p | grep -q "bypass permissions"; do
  [ "$(date +%s)" -ge "$deadline" ] && { echo "BANNER_TIMEOUT"; break; }
  sleep 2
done
```

## Step 2 — Send setup prompt

Use the **Reliable TUI text entry** pattern from Step 0: clear (two Escapes, 0.4s settle after each), type with `-l` and verify the first 24 characters actually landed, then in a separate call snapshot the pane and submit with `Enter`.

Then run `wait_idle` (Step 0) with Bash-tool `timeout: 595000`.

## Step 3 — Monitor through to completion

The setup runs several turns. After each `wait_idle` returns, decide:

- **`IDLE` + interactive menu present** (`Select`/`Choose`/`Which`/`[1]`/`(y/n)` and the input box is *not* a plain empty `❯`): inspect the options. Prefer the pre-highlighted/default choice — usually just a bare `Enter` — over guessing a number. For a yes/no that matches the requested defaults (e.g. overwrite CLAUDE.md, which the script backs up), send `y`. If a menu is genuinely ambiguous or could misconfigure, **stop and ask the human** rather than guess. After answering, run `wait_idle` again (refresh `PRESNAP` first).
- **`IDLE` + `Setup complete` (or equivalent success summary) visible** in `capture-pane -S -200`: proceed to Step 4.
- **`IDLE`, neither of the above**: the agent may be between turns or waiting on you. Re-capture; if it asked a question, answer it; otherwise nudge with a bare `Enter` and `wait_idle` once more.
- **`TIMEOUT`**: follow the chaining rule from Step 0 — keep waiting (up to 3 chained calls) only while pane content is still visibly moving; stop and report if it's static.
- **`NOSTART`**: follow Step 0's guard — this already accounted for "it actually finished fast," so a real `NOSTART` here means the prompt genuinely didn't submit. Retry once as described, then report if it recurs.

Do not rely on the literal string `Setup complete` alone — Step 6 is the real gate.

**Before proceeding to Step 4**, verify that setup actually finished by checking two artifacts on disk:

```bash
grep -q "<!-- OMC:START -->" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md && echo "CLAUDE.md: ok" || echo "CLAUDE.md: MISSING — do not proceed"
test -f ~/.claude/.omc-config.json && echo "omc-config: ok" || echo "omc-config: MISSING — nudge needed"
```

If `omc-config` is MISSING, the setup did not reach its final phase (it saves progress mid-run and can go idle before writing the config). Nudge the inner agent using the same clear/type/verify pattern from Step 0:

```bash
PANE=%3
TEXT='finalize omc setup — create .omc-config.json if the setup is otherwise complete'
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4; tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" -l "$TEXT"
sleep 0.4
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -qF "${TEXT:0:24}" && echo "typed ok" || echo "TYPE_VERIFY_FAILED"
```

```bash
PANE=%3
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -50 > /tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
```

Run `wait_idle`, re-run the check, then proceed to Step 4 once both show `ok`.

## Step 4 — Restart to activate the HUD

The HUD statusline only takes effect on a fresh start. Exit cleanly. `/exit` is a slash command, so use the proactive double-`Enter` pattern from Step 0 (dropdown autocomplete otherwise eats the first `Enter`):

```bash
PANE=%3
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4; tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" Escape; sleep 0.4
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" -l '/exit'
sleep 0.4
```

```bash
PANE=%3
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -50 > /tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
sleep 0.5
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
```

Wait for the shell to return (Claude UI gone), bounded:

```bash
PANE=%3
deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + 60 ))
until ! tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p | grep -q "bypass permissions"; do
  [ "$(date +%s)" -ge "$deadline" ] && { echo "EXIT_TIMEOUT"; break; }
  sleep 1
done
```

Restart (shell command — single call is fine):

```bash
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" 'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions' Enter
```

Wait for the banner again (reuse the Step 1 wait).

## Step 5 — Run doctor

Plain text, not a slash command — no dropdown risk, but still use the verified-entry pattern since it's cheap and closes off the dropped-character failure mode entirely:

```bash
PANE=%3
TEXT='run omc doctor'
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" -l "$TEXT"
sleep 0.4
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -qF "${TEXT:0:12}" && echo "typed ok" || echo "TYPE_VERIFY_FAILED"
```

```bash
PANE=%3
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -50 > /tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt
tmux send-keys -t "$PANE" '' Enter
```

Run `wait_idle` (Step 0; a shorter `idle_budget=300`/Bash `timeout: 340000` is plenty for doctor), then capture the report:

```bash
tmux capture-pane -t "$PANE" -p -S -200
```

Note whether it reports `HEALTHY` / `DEGRADED` / `CRITICAL`.

## Step 6 — Independent verification (do not skip)

This is the real success gate. You run these yourself, against the shared filesystem — they do not depend on what the inner agent said:

```bash
# OMC installed in global CLAUDE.md
grep -q "<!-- OMC:START -->" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md && echo "CLAUDE.md: OMC ok" || echo "CLAUDE.md: MISSING"
# Pre-existing import preserved (the inner agent has falsely warned this was lost)
grep -q "@RTK" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md && echo "RTK: preserved" || echo "RTK: CHECK backup"
# statusLine wired up and caveman badge appears last in live output
# (inner agent may use a wrapper script — test live output, not the command string)
{ jq -r '.statusLine.command' ~/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null | grep -q "caveman" \
  || sh -c "$(jq -r '.statusLine.command' ~/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "CAVEMAN"; } \
  && echo "statusLine: caveman-last ok" || echo "statusLine: CHECK"
# config + HUD artifacts exist
test -f ~/.claude/.omc-config.json && echo "omc-config: ok" || echo "omc-config: MISSING"
ls ~/.claude/hud/*.mjs >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "HUD: installed" || echo "HUD: MISSING"
```

Confirm the live statusline in the running pane shows the OMC segment first and the caveman badge last (e.g. `[OMC#...L] | ... [CAVEMAN]`).

## Step 7 — Report

Summarize to the user: doctor verdict **plus** your independent Step 6 results. If any check failed or any wait returned `TIMEOUT`/`ABORT`, say so explicitly with the captured evidence — do not soften a partial result into "done". If any `wait_idle` resolved via the aliasing guard (pane diff instead of catching `esc to interrupt` directly) or any `TYPE_VERIFY_FAILED`/retry occurred, mention it — it's a signal the pane is behaving oddly even if the end state looks fine.

## Constraints

- **Two-call rule for ALL Claude Code TUI input** (prompts, commands, confirmations): text call, then bare `Enter` call. Shell commands outside the TUI may use the combined form.
- **Settle delay after every discrete TUI keystroke action** (`sleep 0.4` after Escape, after typing, before the next action) — sending the next key before the Ink UI's render pass settles is how characters and `Enter` presses get silently dropped.
- **Verify typed text before submitting** (Step 0's clear/type/verify loop) instead of trusting a blind `send-keys` — this catches a dropped leading character before it becomes a mistyped command, rather than discovering it after the fact.
- **Slash commands get a proactive double-`Enter`** (Step 0) — the autocomplete dropdown can consume the first one as a selection, not a submit.
- **`wait_idle` requires 2 consecutive clean polls before declaring `IDLE`**, and falls back to a presubmit-snapshot diff before declaring `NOSTART` — a single missed poll of `esc to interrupt` between chained tool calls, or a turn that finished faster than the poll caught it, must not be misread.
- **Never poll with `sleep N && cmd` chained in one Bash call** — the harness blocks it. Use a single Bash call containing a `while`/`until` loop with an internal `sleep` (as in Step 0).
- **A single Bash call cannot be timed out past 600000ms (10 min).** Keep `wait_idle`'s internal `idle_deadline` at 540s and request Bash-tool `timeout: 595000` — never set the internal deadline equal to (or above) the Bash-tool timeout; a prior run set both to 600s/600000ms and the harness's own kill silently discarded the script's result. If a step is legitimately slow, chain additional bounded `wait_idle` calls (cap ~3) rather than requesting one longer call.
- **Shell state does not persist between your Bash calls.** Hardcode the literal pane id (`%N` from Step 1) into every block, and use a file (e.g. `/tmp/omc-presnap-3.txt`), not a shell variable, to carry a snapshot from one call to the next.
- **Detect state from chrome** (`esc to interrupt`, `bypass permissions`), not from spinner verbs or specific summary wording.
- **Clear the input buffer with two `Escape` presses** (short gap between, e.g. `Escape; sleep 0.4; Escape`) before typing into the TUI — a single Escape does not reliably clear it, and you would concatenate onto stray text.
- **Trust the filesystem over the inner agent.** Its claims and warnings (especially "you lost X") can be wrong; verify in Step 6.
- Do not use `/omc` slash commands to start setup; plain text triggers the hook chain that loads the skills.
- The HUD statusline activates only after a full restart, not mid-session.
- Capture with `-S -200` so output that scrolled off the visible region is still inspected.
