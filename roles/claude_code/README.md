# claude_code

Ansible role that installs [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI
on Linux for each desktop user, verifies binary integrity, installs the
[oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) and
[caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) Claude Code plugins,
symlinks skills from an [ai-agent-workspace](https://github.com/eudicy/ai-agent-workspace)
clone (provisioned by the `ai_agent_workspace` role) into `~/.claude/skills`,
and configures the [Exa](https://exa.ai) MCP server for web search.

`beads`, `specify_cli`, and the ai-agent-workspace clone are cross-harness
CLI tools installed by their own single-purpose roles, not by `claude_code`.
Those roles must run before this one (`ai_agent_workspace` specifically,
since the retained symlink task depends on its clone already existing). The
`rtk` role installs only the `rtk` binary; `rtk init -g` and the `omc` CLI +
oh-my-claudecode source clone are installed here instead — see `DESIGN.md`
for why.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.19+
- `git` present on target hosts (used for Claude Code plugin marketplace and
  oh-my-claudecode source clones)
- The `ai_agent_workspace` role applied first, providing
  `~/Documents/Cline/ai-agent-workspace`
- The `rtk` role applied first, providing `/usr/local/bin/rtk`
- `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` and a Node.js LTS install present for each target user
  (production: `playbooks/setup-nodejs.yml`; this role's own Molecule
  scenario provisions it as a test-only fixture — see `DESIGN.md`)
- Internet access from target hosts (downloads Claude Code, plugins, and the
  omc CLI)

## Role Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude_code_manifest_base_url` | Google Storage URL | Base URL for the Claude Code release manifest |
| `claude_code_platform_map` | `{x86_64: linux-x64, aarch64: linux-arm64}` | Maps `ansible_architecture` to Claude Code platform string |
| `desktop_user_names` | *(required)* | List of local usernames to install Claude Code for |
| `desktop_users` | *(required)* | List of user objects with `name`, `password`, and `exa_api_key` |

## Dependencies

None. See `meta/main.yml` for details.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: desktops
  roles:
    - role: claude_code
      vars:
        desktop_user_names:
          - alice
          - bob
        desktop_users:
          - name: alice
            password: "{{ vault_alice_password }}"
            exa_api_key: "{{ vault_alice_exa_api_key }}"
          - name: bob
            password: "{{ vault_bob_password }}"
            exa_api_key: "{{ vault_bob_exa_api_key }}"
```

## What This Role Does

1. Verifies the target architecture is supported
2. Fetches the latest Claude Code version and release manifest
3. Downloads and runs the official Claude Code installer for each user
   (skipped if already installed)
4. Verifies the installed binary checksum against the release manifest
5. Adds `~/.local/bin` to each user's `PATH` via `.bashrc`
6. Symlinks skills from the `ai_agent_workspace` role's clone into
   `~/.claude/skills/` (idempotent; re-provision re-links)
7. Registers and installs the oh-my-claudecode Claude Code plugin
8. Registers and installs the caveman Claude Code plugin
9. Registers the claude-plugins-official marketplace and installs the
   context7 plugin
10. Clones the oh-my-claudecode source repo and installs the `omc` CLI
    (`oh-my-claude-sisyphus`, skipped if already installed)
11. Initializes rtk globally (`rtk init -g`) for each desktop user
12. Merges required keys (agent-team env vars, rtk/bd-guard hooks) into
    `settings.json`
13. Configures the [Exa](https://exa.ai) MCP server (`exa`) with the user's API
    key (skipped if already registered)

## Post-install Manual Steps

After running the playbook, each user must complete initial setup interactively.
The role installs the plugins but does not configure them — that requires a
running Claude Code session. To simplify the process, the role copies a prompt
file to `~/Documents/Cline/setup-omc-prompt.md` to automate the setup steps.

1. `cd ~/Documents/Cline`
2. Run `claude` to open a Claude Code session.
3. Copy paste this prompt verbatim: `@setup-omc-prompt.md`
   The prompt instructs Claude to:
   - spawn a second Claude Code session in a new tmux pane
   - run `omc setup` in that pane (global install, suggested defaults, no MCP,
     caveman badge in the statusline)
   - restart the pane session and run `omc doctor` to verify the result

   The Exa MCP server is pre-configured by the role and does not need to be set
   up through `omc setup`. If the GitHub MCP is desired, a GitHub personal access
   token is required and must be provided when prompted.
4. Run `/caveman` to activate caveman mode.
